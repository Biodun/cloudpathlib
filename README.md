> Our goal is to be the meringue of file management libraries: the subtle sweetness of `pathlib` working in harmony with the ethereal lightness of the cloud.

A library that implements (nearly all) of the `pathlib.Path` methods for URIs for different cloud providers.

```python
with CloudPath("s3://bucket/filename.txt").open("w+") as f:
    f.write("Send my changes to the cloud!")
```

## Why use cloudpathlib?

 - **Familiar**: If you know how to interact with `Path`, you know how to interact with `CloudPath`. All of the cloud-relevant `Path` methods are implemented.
 - **Supported clouds**: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storate, are implemented and Google Cloud Storage, and FTP are on the way.
 - **Extensible**: The base classes do most of the work generically, so implementing a two small classes `MyPath` and `MyClient` is all you need to add a cloud provider.
 - **Read/write support**: Reading just works. Using the `write_text`, `write_bytes` or `.open('w')` methods will all upload your changes to the cloud provider without any additional file management as a developer.
 - **Seamless caching**: Files are downloaded locally only when necessary, and you can easily pass a persistent cache folder so that across processes and sessions you only re-download what is necessary.
 - **Tested**: Comprehensive test suite and code coverage.


## Supported methods and properties

Most methods and properties from `pathlib.Path` are supported except for the ones that don't make sense in a cloud context. There are a few additional methods or properties that relate to specific cloud services or specifically for cloud paths.

Here's an example to get the gist:

```python
from cloudpathlib import S3Path

root_dir = S3Path("s3://drivendata-public-assets/")

# there's only one file, but globbing works in nested folder
for f in root_dir.glob('**/*.txt'):
    text_data = f.read_text()
    print(f)
    print(text_data)

# use / to join paths (and, in this case, create a new file)
new_file_copy = root_dir / "nested_dir/copy_file.txt"

# show things work and the file does not exist yet
print(new_file_copy)
print(new_file_copy.exists())

# writing text data to the new file in the cloud
new_file_copy.write_text(text_data)

# file now listed
print(list(root_dir.glob('**/*.txt')))

# but, we can remove it
new_file_copy.unlink()

# no longer there
print(list(root_dir.glob('**/*.txt')))

```

Results in printing the following:
